# Genetic Algorithms: Solving the N-Queens problem

This project was developed for the Computational Intelligence for Optimization course in the Master's degree in Data Science and Advanced Analytics (NOVA IMS).

The goal was to develop code to solve and compare solutions for the N-Queens problem using Evolutionary Algorithms with Object Oriented Programming. In Summary, the N-Queens problem aims to spread queens over an N*N chessboard in such a way that they do can not kill eachother.

## Main Steps

- Defining the Fitness function, coding, comparing and choosing selection, crossover and mutation operators and parameters.
